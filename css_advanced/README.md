### Project Details

- **Objective**: Implement the HTML structure of the SmileSchool webpage from a Figma design file.
- **Scope**: Only HTML structure, no CSS or styling is to be applied.

### Design Reference

- **Figma File**: Access the SmileSchool design file and duplicate it to your drafts for detailed design specifications.

### Fonts

- Ensure you have the following fonts installed:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](#) (Link to the font source)

### Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Access the Figma design file and review the layout and content specifications.
   - Ensure all design elements are properly understood for accurate HTML representation.

2. **HTML Structure Implementation**
   - Use semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.
   - Ensure the structure follows the design hierarchy:
     - **Header**: Contains the logo, navigation links (Courses, Pricing, Login), and a central call-to-action ("Get schooled").
     - **Main Content**: Includes sections like "Learn from the pros," user testimonials, most popular tutorials, and FAQ.
     - **Footer**: Contains additional links, copyright information, and social media icons.
   - Properly nest elements and maintain a clean and readable HTML structure.

3. **Validation**
   - Validate your HTML using an HTML validator to ensure there are no syntax errors.
   - Ensure accessibility by using appropriate ARIA roles and labels where necessary.
